Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words word1 and word2 and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list. Your method will be called repeatedly many times with different parameters. 

Example:
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1

class WordDistance {

    HashMap<String, ArrayList<Integer>> locations;

    public WordDistance(String[] words) {
        this.locations = new HashMap<String, ArrayList<Integer>>();

        // Prepare a mapping from a word to all it's locations (indices).
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            
            if(!locations.containsKey(words[i])) locations.put(words[i],new ArrayList<>());
            locations.get(words[i]).add(i);
        }
    }

    public int shortest(String word1, String word2) {
        ArrayList<Integer> loc1, loc2;

        // Location lists for both the words
        // the indices will be in SORTED order by default
        loc1 = this.locations.get(word1);
        loc2 = this.locations.get(word2);

        int l1 = 0, l2 = 0, minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        while (l1 < loc1.size() && l2 < loc2.size()) {
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, Math.abs(loc1.get(l1) - loc2.get(l2)));
            if (loc1.get(l1) < loc2.get(l2)) {
                l1++;
            } else {
                l2++;
            }
        }

        return minDiff;
    }
}
