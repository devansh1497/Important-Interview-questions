From the above figure, we can observe that our problem statement is very similar to the Preorder traversal. Actually, the order of traversal is the same(except for the right boundary nodes, for which it is the reverse), but we need to selectively include the nodes in the return result list. Thus, we need to include only those nodes in the result, which are either on the left boundary, the leaves or the right boundary.

In order to distinguish between the various kinds of nodes, we make use of a flag as follows:

Flag=0: Root Node.

Flag=1: Left Boundary Node.

Flag=2: Right Boundary Node.

Flag=3: Others(Middle Node).

We make use of three lists left_boundary,right_boundary,leaves to store the appropriate nodes and append the three lists at the end.

We go for the normal preorder traversal, but while calling the recursive function for preorder traversal using the left child or the right child of the current node, we also pass the flag information indicating the type of node that the current child behaves like.

For obtaining the flag information about the left child of the current node, we make use of the function leftChildFlag(node, flag). In the case of a left child, the following cases are possible, as can be verified by looking at the figure above:

The current node is a left boundary node: In this case, the left child will always be a left boundary node. e.g. relationship between E & J in the above figure.

The current node is a root node: In this case, the left child will always be a left boundary node. e.g. relationship between A & B in the above figure.

The current node is a right boundary node: In this case, if the right child of the current node doesn't exist, the left child always acts as the right boundary node. e.g. G & N. But, if the right child exists, the left child always acts as the middle node. e.g. C & F.

Similarly, for obtaining the flag information about the right child of the current node, we make use of the function rightChildFlag(node, flag). In the case of a right child, the following cases are possible, as can be verified by looking at the figure above:

The current node is a right boundary node: In this case, the right child will always be a right boundary node. e.g. relationship between C & G in the above figure.

The current node is a root node: In this case, the right child will always be a left boundary node. e.g. relationship between A & C in the above figure.

The current node is a left boundary node: In this case, if the left child of the current node doesn't exist, the right child always acts as the left boundary node. e.g. B & E. But, if the left child exists, the left child always acts as the middle node.

Making use of the above information, we set the flag appropriately, which is used to determine the list in which the current node has to be appended.

Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : 
O(n) One complete traversal of the tree is done.

Space complexity : 
O(n) The recursive stack can grow upto a depth of n. Further, left_boundary, right_boundary and leavescombined together can be of size n.
