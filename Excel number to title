Given a positive integer, return its corresponding column title as appear in an Excel sheet.

For example:

    1 -> A
    2 -> B
    3 -> C
    ...
    26 -> Z
    27 -> AA
    28 -> AB 
    ...
Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: "A"
Example 2:

Input: 28
Output: "AB"
Example 3:

Input: 701
Output: "ZY"


IMP -> This question is about converting a base 10 number to base 26.
NOTE-> HOWEVER ALL BASES START FROM 0 (BASED INDEXING TO) * WHERE * IS THE MAXIMUM LIMIT. IN OUR CASE, * IS 26.
HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO THE QUESTION, SINCE "A" STARTS FROM 1 BASED INDEXING, WE NEED TO CONVERT IT TO 0 BASED INDEXING. 
FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE ALWAYS DO N-1 IN THE FOR LOOP!!!

class Solution:
    # @return a string
    def convertToTitle(self, num):
        capitals = [chr(x) for x in range(ord('A'), ord('Z')+1)]
        result = []
        while num > 0:
            result.append(capitals[(num-1)%26])
            num = (num-1) // 26
        result.reverse()
        return ''.join(result)
